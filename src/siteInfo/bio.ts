    aboutMe: `Hey, I'm Glen!  Currently I am working as a Cloud Software Engineer at Indeed.  I really enjoy creating new web applications and expanding current ones to make our customers’ lives a little easier.  I find that taking even a small idea and bringing it to fruition is very exciting and allows me to be passionate about my work.  My goal is to be able to chase this passion with more significant and impactful projects until I can help provide millions of people with something that they truly enjoy using.

I live in Portland, Michigan with my beautiful fiancé Mae and our pupper Loki.  In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, and playing sports.  When I am not outside, you can generally find me on the computer programming small projects, prepping role-playing adventures for my friends, or playing video games.
