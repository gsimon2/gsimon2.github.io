    aboutMe: `Hey, I'm Glen!  Currently I am working as a Cloud Software Engineer at TechSmith.  I love creating new web applications or expanding current ones to make our customersâ€™ lives a little better.  Taking even a small idea bringing it to fruition excites me greatly and provides immense satisfaction.  My goal is to be able to chase this passion with more significant and impactful projects until I can help provide millions of people with something that they truly enjoy using.

I currently live in Portland, Michigan with my beautiful fiance Mae, my goofy pupper Loki, and my devious cat Latte.  In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, and playing sports.  When I am not outside, you can generally find me on the computer working on projects such as programming small modules for applications that I use, prepping role-playing adventures for my friends, or playing video games.
